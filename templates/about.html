          Hi, I’m <strong>Sachin</strong> 👋 — a software engineer and computer science
          enthusiast with a strong interest in building secure, scalable, and
          meaningful applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          I created this blog as a space to share my thoughts, learnings, and
          experiments around technology, programming, and problem-solving.
          Sometimes that means writing about backend systems, security,
          authentication flows, or cloud deployments. Other times, it’s about
          lessons learned while building real projects from scratch.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe the best way to learn is by building and explaining.
          This blog helps me document that journey — the mistakes, the fixes,
          and the “aha” moments — while hopefully helping others who are on a
          similar path.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thanks for stopping by. If something here helps you or sparks an idea,
          then this blog has already done its job.
        </p>
